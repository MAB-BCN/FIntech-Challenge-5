In this Challenge, we created two financial analysis tools by using a single Jupyter notebook:

Financial analysis 1 is a financial planner that allows individuals to visualize their current savings, and determine if they have enough reserves for an emergency fund.

Financial analysis 2 is a financial planner for retirement that allows individuals to forecast the performance of their retirement portfolio in 30 years using a 60/40 split between stocks and bonds vs 10 years using an 80/20 split between stocks and bonds. 

The analysis make an Alpaca API call via the Alpaca SDK to get historical price data for use in various Monte Carlo simulations.
